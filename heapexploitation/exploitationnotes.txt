Heap exploits are extremely dependent on libc version as newer checks are introduced over time

Additional pointer verification 
Safe-linking 
__malloc_hook depreciation 

taking advantage of consolidation

chunks that dont fit in both the tcache and fastbins will go into unsorted bin

a correctly sized (large) malloc request can clear fastbin and trigger consolidation 

conversely,sometimes you will hold an alocation solely to prevent consolidation

guard allocations solely exist  to prevent consolidation from occuing to another chunk



moving chunks between bins:-
chunks move from the unsorted bin to the small/large bins 
clear fastbin with large malloc call
small chunks can move into tcache from smallbins opportunistically

Creating fake chunks:-
by carefully crafting a region of memory  to pass heap metadata validation
checks,fake chunks can be created and be misinterpreted by the heap

Unsafe linking/unlink:-
Instead of creating  a fake chunk,validation steps can be satisied such that
the heap linking and unlinking operations provide an exploit primitive
