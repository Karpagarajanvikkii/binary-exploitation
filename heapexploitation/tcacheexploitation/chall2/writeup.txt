Intial analysis:-
We see the binary has edit,add,delete and show functions,we use IDA to decompile the functions and see if there are any vulnerabilities such as UAF,byte overflow or double free,
We see the add option and find the structure for a person as index,size,firstname,middlename,lastname,age and bio and see their offsets and we also see an address in the bss which contains the array of persons,we dont see anything useful in the add function
so we move on and analyse the delete function and see the pointer gets nulled out after freeing so no UAF, show just shows the info of a person and re-age updates the age of an person and doesnt have anything that useful,
the vulnerability lies in the edit function's bio part as the bio functions offset is 64 but in edit it is there as size - 32  instead of reducing -64 this leads to 32 bytes of heap overflow and as this is a more recent version of libc there are several mitigations
such as removal of malloc_hooks and free_hook and the introduction of tcache's safe linking mechanism which mangles the fd pointer of an free tcache chunk so we should find a way to bypass safe-linking  and also try an alternative way to get a shell instead of writing malloc or free_hook
as they are removed in this version, we can overwrite the got table as relro is partial and PIE is also disabled, so lets start the exploitation part.

Exploitation:-
I have made detailed comments on what we do and why we do it of each step in the script
