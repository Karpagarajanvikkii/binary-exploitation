Initial analysis:-
we see that the program has three functions, Malloc,Free,Show using IDA we decompile the functions and see what they are doing and look for potential bugs such as double free
UAF, we see that the free functions doesn't have a UAF as the pointers get nulled out when freeing, show also doesn't have anything vulnerbale it just outputs the content that
we wrote when allocating a chunk using the malloc chunk, so when checking the malloc function we find that we can allocate two sizes of chunks 0xf8(248) and if we pick a value greater than that 
0x178(376), but when allocated because of metadata it will be 0x101 and 0x181, then when it reads from the input, a while loop happens like v2 === v3 where v2 is the input and v3 is the choosen chunksize
so we get a single byte overflow here, as the loop is run until chunksize instead of stopping at v2 < v3, which would have prevented that so we get the ability to overflow a single byte into the next chunk, another thing is that tcache has a default max capacity of 7, so when
we free a 8th chunk it goes into the unsorted bin and its fd pointer is updated to a main arena libc address so we can use the show function to get a libc, when keep the contents empty
now lets start with the exploitation part.

For the exploitation part i have made detailed comments of each step in the script
