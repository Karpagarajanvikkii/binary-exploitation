In this challenge we have to write flag.txt to bss but the gadgets are not
straightforward as they were in the previous challenges so we need to use the
exisiting gadgets and construct a write primitive, the new and existing gadgets
are stosb,xlat,bextr after reading about them we come to know that we can 
chain these three to construct a write primitive, first we control bextr to get
our flag.txt into rbx,then xlat to mov that into al and stosb which takes the 
characters of flag.txt from the bss address  and saves it to rdi,which is what we want exactly then we call the print_file function and it works, but for
this we search flag.txt character by character in the binary using a script and
append it and write it to bss using stosb
