There is an restriction on some characters being used, so we are not able to 
write flag.txt into bss directly, after analyzing we see that there's an xor
gadget which we can use to our advantage, so we reverse the string to "txt.galf"
,then xor it by 2 and convert it into hex and write it into bss, so before
callinf the print_file function we convert the string to it's original form by
looping through it and xoring it again with 2 using the xor gadget, then we 
convert it back to it's original form and call the print file function using
poprdi and the reconverted string as its arguement, and it works
