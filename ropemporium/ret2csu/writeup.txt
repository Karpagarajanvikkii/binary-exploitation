In this challenge we are required to call the ret2win function with three 
arguements, this challenge is similar to callme challenge but there are a lack 
of gadgets and they are'nt straightforward after using ROPgadget we see that 
only pop rdi gadget is there, so we read about ret2csu or universal rop in 
which the compiled libc with the binary  contains useful gadgets in __libc_csu_init
which can be used when there is a lack of gadgets like in the current case,
we need to satisfy few conditions like rbx and rbp shouldn't be equal and rbx must
be set to 0 so that the address pointed to by r12 is called, and we need to 
restore rdi later as the gadget stores it in edi so the arguement becomes 
0xdeadbeef instead of 0xdeadbeefddeadbeef, first we use the pop_chain gadget
and set rbx = 0 and rbp = 1 then for r12 we find an pointer to an add sub ret
gadget inside the binary, then we save the specific variables like cafebabecafebabe
into rsi and d00df00dd00df00d into rdx by placing them into r14 and r15 which is
later moved to rsi and rdx by the csu gadget, then we call the csu_gadget and 
either send the junk of A*56 i.e that is 56 bytes  which is required reach return so the exploit works
or pop 0 seven times  to reach return  and restore deadbeefdeadbeef into
rdi using pop rdi and finally call the win function and it works
