In this challenge there is not enough space on the stack to send our exploit 
chain so we need to fake the location of the stack to get space for our exploit
chain in order to do that we pivot the stack i.e fake the location of rsp to 
get additional stack space, so use we use ROPgadget to see if there are any 
useful gadgets for pivoting and find that xchg rsp,rax is present so we use 
other gadgets and chain them to achieve this, luckily there is a leak provided
for pivoting in this challenge so we receive and save it an variable so that 
we can use it later, first we call foothold_plt,then place the got address of
foothold function into rax using pop rax and write it using mov qword gadget,
in order to call ret2win from libpivot.so we need to calculate the offset 
between foothold_function and ret2win, we use objdump to get the adresses and 
calculate the offset from in order to save that we use pop rbp to get the value
inside it and use add_rax_rbp gadget to add the offset to rax and then we call
rax using call rax gadget, now the chain for pivoting is done , now we send 
the smash and fake the location of the stack so that our chain works and
flag.txt is  printed out, we send junk till it reaches just before the return
address that's 40 after we use pop rax and put the saved leaked address into it
and use xchg rsp,rax to move the address from rax to rsp which in response 
fakes the location of the stack, letting us achieve our desired result and it
works.
