In this challenge only _start function makes sense,there's a write and read
syscall is being used in it, we find the offset using pwn.cyclic and find it 
to be 20 we note an interesting gadget which can print the stack leak, we use 
it to get leak of the stack, then we get the execve shellcode from shellstorm 
then we send stage2 of our payload junk of 20 bytes to fill the buffer then we 
point eip to leak+20(i.e where our shellcode begins) then send it with the
shellcode and boom! it works.
